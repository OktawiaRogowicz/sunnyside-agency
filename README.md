This is a solution to the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef">Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor</a>! 


For my first ever encounter with Frontend Mentor, as well as one of first projects made with React, I chose something that seemed quick and easy to finish - just to test my skills and to see if the format of learning was good for me. As it turns out, I liked it a lot, and the results can be seen below!

### What I learned

The challenge I picked allowed me to quickly and easilly test my knowledge, allowing me to focus on building the website quickly. I focused on React and Styled components, using mostly flexbox - however, in the future, I want to build a website based on a CSS grid. It was also a good practice on responsive websites - even though everything works as it should, I will definitelly work on making the code more readable and accessable once I get to know good practices better.

### Continued development

As this project was still one of my first projects made with React, I want to focus on clean code and good practice - especially once I get feedback on the code, so I can visit it back again.

When it comes to things I would love to get to know, styled components and React are still on this list. However, I would also love to include an API of some sort in my future project, as well as at some point, get to know Vue.js.

Reasons above are the reason why for my next challange, I picked <a href="https://github.com/OktawiaRogowicz/ip-address-tracker"><strong>2. API Address </strong>Tracker</a>.
